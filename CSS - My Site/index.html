          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <div class="profile-paragraph">
            <p>I am a multi-discipline engineering manager (electrical by education).</p>
            <p>I have a strong passion for learning which has led me to develop software coding skills in JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, SAP UI5, Python and Java. As a side hustle, coding has taken me halfway around the world as an SAP partner and culminated in the development of an Internet of Things product with FuturoWare.</p>
            <p>I continue to take classes from LinkedIn, Udemy and read many many books to keep my coding chops up-to-date.</p>
            <p>If you would like to check out our product demos, including the SAP module and the android proof of concept app you can find them here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=futuroware">IoT</a>.</p>
            <p>In the semiconductor industry, I have held engineering and management positions in facilities, projects, electrical distribution, life-safety/fire protection, instrumentation and controls, bulk gas distribution and environmental health and safety.</p>
            <p>In commercial nuclear power and the US Department of Energy (DOE), I have held positions in licensing, project/program management, electrical and fire protection. I am a qualified fire protection engineer and electrical engineer at several US plants and the US DOE (Nevada National Security Site). I was an expert panel member for the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and I am a co-author of NUREG/CR 7150 and contributor to the lesser known NUREG 2128. I have vast experience in working with authorities having jurisdiction at all levels: federal, state and local, as well as insurance carriers. You can find a copy of the NUREG/CR here: <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/contract/cr7150/">NUREG</a>".</p>
            <p>I have worked in the pharmaceutical and food processing industries as a project engineer and manager with several instrumentation and controls upgrades and facility/process expansion projects under my belt.</p>
            <p>Early in my career, I was an application engineer for Eaton Corporation's Truck Components Operations North America, where I wrote vehicle simulation software and worked with vehicle manufacturers to specify drivetrain components for both commercial and military vehicles.</p>
            <p>I've been fortunate to have been a driving member of several successful teams. I've learned to be humbled by my successes and schooled by my failures. I am most excited when I'm helping others find their passion and success.</p>
            <p>Na zdraví! (Czech for "To Health" - Cheers!)</p>
